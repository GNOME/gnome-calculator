      GNOME Calculator is an application that solves mathematical equations.
      Though it at first appears to be a simple calculator with only basic
      arithmetic operations, you can switch into Advanced, Financial, or
      Programming mode to find a surprising set of capabilities.
    </_p>
    <_p>
      The Advanced calculator supports many operations, including:
      logarithms, factorials, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions,
      modulus division, complex numbers, random number generation, prime
      factorization and unit conversions.
    </_p>
    <_p>
      Financial mode supports several computations, including periodic interest
      rate, present and future value, double declining and straight line
      depreciation, and many others.
    </_p>
    <_p>
      Programming mode supports conversion between common bases (binary, octal,
      decimal, and hexadecimal), boolean algebra, one’s and two’s complementation,
      character to character code conversion, and more.
