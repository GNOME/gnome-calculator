"\n"
"The sum-of-the-years'-digits method of depreciation accelerates the rate of "
"depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods "
"than in later ones.\n"
"\n"
"The depreciable cost is the actual cost minus salvage value. The useful life "
"is the number of periods (typically years) over which an asset is "
"depreciated.\n"
"\n"
"Memory register usage:\n"
"\n"
"   Register 0 - cost     (cost of the asset)\n"
"   Register 1 - salvage  (salvage value of the asset)\n"
"   Register 2 - life     (useful life of the asset)\n"
"   Register 3 - period   (period for which depreciation is computed)\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"You have just purchased an office machine for $8,000. The useful life of "
"this machine is six years, and the salvage value after eight years will be "
"$900.\n"
"\n"
"You want to compute the depreciation expense for the fourth year, using the "
"sum-of-the-years'- digits method.\n"
"\n"
"Memory register usage:\n"

"   Register 3 - 4       (period for which depreciation is computed)\n"
